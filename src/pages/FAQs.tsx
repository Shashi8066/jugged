      id: "kumbh-mela",
      question: "What is Kumbh Mela and how often does it occur?",
      answer: "Kumbh Mela is one of the world's largest peaceful religious gatherings, held at four sacred locations in India: Prayagraj (Allahabad), Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. It occurs every 12 years at each location, rotating among these four cities. The Maha Kumbh Mela, held only in Prayagraj every 144 years, is considered the most sacred. During these festivals, millions of pilgrims gather to take holy baths in sacred rivers for spiritual purification and liberation from sins."
    },
    {
      id: "amavasya-purnima",
      question: "What is the difference between Amavasya and Purnima?",
      answer: "Amavasya (new moon) and Purnima (full moon) are two significant lunar phases in Hindu tradition. Amavasya occurs when the moon is completely dark and is considered ideal for ancestor worship (Pitru Paksha), fasting, and introspective spiritual practices. Purnima happens when the moon is completely illuminated and is considered highly auspicious for prayers, charity, meditation, and spiritual ceremonies. Many Hindu festivals are celebrated on these lunar dates, making them important for planning religious observances."
    },
    {
      id: "snan-muhurat",
      question: "How are Snan Muhurat dates determined?",
      answer: "Snan Muhurat dates are determined based on ancient Vedic astronomy and Hindu calendar calculations. These sacred bathing times are calculated considering planetary positions, lunar phases, solar transitions, and traditional astronomical observations. The most auspicious Snan dates include Makar Sankranti, Mauni Amavasya, Vasant Panchami, and other significant festivals. Our Snan Muhurat tool provides these dates along with optimal timing windows when spiritual benefits are believed to be maximized."
    },
    {
      id: "festival-dates",
      question: "Why do Hindu festivals fall on different dates each year?",
      answer: "Hindu festivals follow the lunar calendar (Panchang) rather than the solar Gregorian calendar used internationally. The lunar year is approximately 11 days shorter than the solar year, causing festival dates to shift annually when viewed through the Gregorian calendar. Additionally, Hindu festivals are determined by specific lunar phases, planetary positions, and astronomical calculations that vary each year. This is why festivals like Diwali, Holi, and Janmashtami appear on different dates each year in the modern calendar."
    },
    {
      id: "planning-rituals",
      question: "Can I use jugaadcore tools for planning rituals and temple visits?",
      answer: "Absolutely! jugaadcore is designed to help you plan spiritual activities effectively. Our tools provide accurate dates for festivals, Amavasya/Purnima, and Snan Muhurat timings that can help you schedule temple visits, religious ceremonies, and personal spiritual practices.

    },
    {
      id: "accuracy-reliability",
      question: "Is the information on JugaadCore accurate and reliable?",
      answer: "JugaadCore provides information based on traditional Hindu calendar calculations and widely accepted astronomical data. While we strive for accuracy, dates and timings can vary slightly based on regional practices, local traditions, and different Panchang calculations. We recommend using our information as a general reference and consulting with local religious authorities, priests, or traditional calendars for precise ritual timings and region-specific observances. Always verify important dates through multiple reliable sources."
    },
    {
